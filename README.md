<br>

The following elements were used in this project:

1. Constants (const): Defined constants representing various form elements, such as login and registration links, form fields, buttons, etc.

2. Event Listeners: Added event listeners to "loginLink" and "registerLink" links, triggering appropriate functions in response to clicks.

3. Functions: Defined several functions, like "checkUsername," "checkEmail," "checkPassword," "checkBox," "updateErrorCount," and "clearBtn," handling form validation and error management.

4. Data Validation: Utilized functions "checkUsername," "checkEmail," and "checkPassword" to validate user input in form fields (username, email, and password).

5. Error Handling: If data is invalid, relevant CSS classes are added to form elements to display error messages.

6. Confirmation of Consent: The "checkBox" function checks if the user has consented to the terms of service.

7. Button Handling: Event listeners on "btnRegister" and "btnLogin" buttons call appropriate functions during registration and login attempts.

8. Success Messages: Displays success messages upon successful form completion without errors.

9. Form Field Clearing: The "clearBtn" function clears the form fields after successful registration or login.

The project combines JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to provide form interactivity and validation on the website.
